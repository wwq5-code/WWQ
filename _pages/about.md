I'm a third year PhD student from University of Technology Sydney (UTS), supervised by [Prof. Shui Yu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shui.Yu).
 
 
My research interest is **privacy and security in machine learning**. During my PhD period, I mainly focused on machine unlearning.
1. Machine Unlearning:
   - New Algorithms for Machine Unlearning and Federated Unlearning
   - Prevent Privacy Leakage during Machine Unlearning
   - Auditing and Verification of Machine Unlearning
